Juju is a universal ‘operator lifecycle manager’ (OLM)
developed by Canonical. Juju allows developers and
operations engineers to deploy, integrate, or upgrade complex
applications using only a few commands.

Juju is much more than a configuration management system. You can use Juju to:

 * Deploy applications.
 * Configure applications.
 * Integrate applications.
 * Scale applications.
 * Upgrade applications.
 * Perform operational tasks.

Juju was launched in 2010. It is written in Go.
